    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Patrick and I’m a web developer and an avid WordPress user.</p>
    <p>I currently work as a QA Engineer at <a href="https://wpmudev.com" rel="_blank">WPMU DEV</a>.</p> 
    <p>I love sharing new tips on WordPress, blogging, and web design as a whole. I was the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/01/18/wordpress-6-5-release-squad-formation/" rel="_blank">Test Lead</a> for the major version 6.5 of WordPress.</p>
    <p>I ❤️ to write. About <a href="https://lumumbas.blog/category/getting-involved/" rel="_blank">WordPress</a>, <a href=="https://medium.com/@lumumbapl" rel="_blank">my daily adventures</a>, and many other subjects.</p>
    <p>If you have a project you think we can both work on, or just want to catch up, be sure to <a href="./index.html">contact me</a>.</a></p>
